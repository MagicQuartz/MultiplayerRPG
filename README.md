# MultiplayerRPG
A multiplayer RPG themed game made in Godot 3.5.1 for my final Computer Science project. Includes (simple and unnecessary - just for showcase) chat message encryption and Rock Paper Scissors.
As of right now, the project only includes client connection from the same computer/server hosting.
